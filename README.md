# Analysis-of-Different-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-Regression-Problem

I worked on an e-commerce dataset and used the "BrandName" , "MRP" and "Discount" columns to find the "SellPrice" of the product.
Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classication, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Naive Bayes and kNN algorithms are used here to compare the result and find out the best classifier for the problem
